# Universal Variability Language (UVL)

Welcome to the **Universal Variability Language (UVL)** organization on GitHub!

---

## About UVL

UVL is a concise, extensible language for modeling variability in software product lines.
This organization houses multiple related projects that support the definition, parsing, tooling, and ecosystem around UVL.
See our public site: https://universal-variability-language.github.io/

### Key Repositories

Here are some of the main projects under this organization:

| Repository | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `uvl-parser` | The grammar / parser definition of UVL, based on ANTLR |
| `java-fm-metamodel` | Java library to manipulate UVL metamodels; uses the UVL grammar |
| `uvl-models` | A repository containing a catalog of publicly available feature models expressed in UVL |
| `uvl-lsp` | A Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation for UVL |
| `uvl-tutorials-material` | Teaching / tutorial resources for UVL usage |
| `UVLEP` | The UVL Enhancement Process (for evolving the language) |

## Organization Governance & Contribution

We aim to maintain transparency, collaboration, and quality across all projects in this organization. Below are some guidelines:

### Contribution Welcome ðŸŽ¯

- **Issue tracker**: Use issues in the respective repository to propose enhancements, report bugs, or request features.
- **Pull requests**: Fork the repo, create a feature branch, commit changes, and open a PR. Please follow the repositoryâ€™s coding / style / testing conventions.
- **Review process**: At least one reviewer will approve changes; maintainers may suggest adjustments.
- **Code of Conduct / License**: Each repository should include a license and a code of conduct. If not present, raise an issue to have one added.

### UVL Enhancement (Language Evolution)

Changes to the UVL language itself should follow a formal proposal process via the `UVLEP` repository.
Language-level changes must be backwards-compatible where possible, or include migration guidance if incompatible.
